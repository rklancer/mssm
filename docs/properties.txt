what set of properties completely define the application state?
what properties must be persisted in the hash?
--- 

tag-hovered         which tag is hovered (1 option)
items-hovered (?)   which items are hovered (set) - remember hovering a detail histogram can "hover" multiple cells
columns-selected    which columns are selected (set)
rows-selected       which rows are selected (set)
cells-selected      which cells are selected (set)

recent-clade        which clade was most recently clicked (1 option)
recent-group        which group was most recently clicked (1 option)
item-open           which item or pair is open (1 option)

annotation-highlight-option     which annotation-highlighting option is current (1 option)
sequence-highlight-option       which sequence-property-highlighting option is current (1 option)
columns-hidden                  which columns are hidden (set)
tagging-menu-open               whether tagging menu is open on selected columns, selected rows, selected cells, or not at all (1 option)
    (consider this derived property: for each tag, whether it is not, partially. or completely selected)
column-tags-list-scroll         scroll position of column-scoped tag list
row-tags-list-scroll            scroll position of row-scoped tag list
cell-tags-list-scroll           scroll position of cell-scoped tag list

current-grouping        which grouping is currently active (1 option) - note that grouping is stored on server
reference-row           which row is the reference sequence (1 option)
sort-columns            which columns are sort columns (ordered list)

tree-threshold          position of tree grouping threshold
alignment-scroll        scroll position of alignment

open-tab                which tab is open

sort-by-score-option    whether to sort column-by-score view (make this apply across tabs)

just-columns tab:
    score-option                which statistic is selected in just-columns view
    sort-by-frequency-option    whether to sort detail histogram by residue frequency

    scores-bar-hovered          which score-histogram bar is hovered. Remember grey segments represent hidden columns.
    (there is no "scores-bar-selected". Bars are selected if the corresponding columns are selected.)
    column-by-score-scroll      scroll position of column-by-score display
    detail-bar-hovered          which bar in detail histogram is hovered (there's a many-to-one relationship between bars hovered and cells hovered, so this is a separate item of state)


column-pairs tab:
    weight-by-branches-option       whether to weight relatedness scores relationship on multiple branches
    limit-to-visible-option         whether to limit to visible columns
    zoomed-scores-bar-hovered       which bar in zoomed-in score histogram is hovered
    zoomed-scores-bar-selected      which bar in zoomed-in score histogram is hovered
    pairs-by-score-bar-hovered      which bar in pairs-by-score histogram is hovered
    2d-histogram-area-hovered       which area in 2d histogram is hovered
    
columns-related-to tab:
    comparison-type-option  which context we're relating (column, tag, clade, group)
    comparison-tag          which row-scoped tag we're relating, if we're relating to row tags

    (which column? This is not a separate item of state -- it's the open one, if any; if pair is open, choosing one results in a single column being open. Which clade? The most recently clicked. Which group? The most recently clicked.)
    
    side-by-side-histogram-bar-hovered      which bar in side-by-side histogram is hovered
