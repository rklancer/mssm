NORASeq colors:

light highlight for nonempty cells and 
#ebead3: hsv(41, 26, 235)

goes well with the contrastier background color for selected cells

#cfbd87: hsv(32, 89, 207)

I propose this color ramp for blue conservation highlighting:

#d0dcff: hsv(159, 47, 255)
to
#90abff: hsv(160, 111, 255)

(note difference is all in the saturation)

for selected + highlighted try:
#919cbe: hsv(160, 60, 190)
to
#6875a0: hsv(160, 90, 160)

or for a little more range try

#a9b3d2: hsv(160, 50, 210)
to
#6875a0: hsv(160, 90, 160)

(note we've adjusted both saturation and value to make a ramp
from light, but still constrasty, blue-grey to dark blue-grey.
This seems to play nicely with the light highlight -> contrasty, "selected" highlight,
and the colors play nicely with a bold, white lettering)
